# BinarySearchTree
Binary Search Tree is a node-based binary tree data structure which has the following properties:

The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys lesser than the node’s key.

The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node’s key.

The left and right subtree each must also be a binary search tree.

This implementation Insers the data in the tree using InsertBinarySearchTree (Name, Number)

Find user and print the phone number using FindCustomerIterative

Starting with first user, traverse the entire tree in inorder back to first user printing the name field of each node encountered. (we should be able to do this starting at any node, i.e.,
find first user using a binary search then traverse the tree from this point in inorder).

Can Traverse the tree in inorder starting at the root using the method InOrderSuccessor.  Print the name and phone number of each node as it is encountered

Can Traverse the tree in pre-order using “procedure PreOrderTraversalIterative(TreePoint: in BinarySearchTreePoint);.”

Can	Traverse the tree in post-order using “procedure PostOrderTraversalIterative( TreePoint: in BinarySearchTreePoint);.”
